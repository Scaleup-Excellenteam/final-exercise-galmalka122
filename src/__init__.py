Instructions:
1. Please wait for the first slide before generating explanations. The slide data will be provided individually.
2. Once you receive each slide, analyze its contents and generate a captivating explanation based on the slide's title and text.
3. Provide a medium level of detail in your explanations, striking a balance between summaries and detailed explanations.
4. Consider the context of previous slides when generating responses to maintain a coherent and cohesive explanation throughout the presentation.
5. Ensure that your responses flow smoothly from one slide to the next, maintaining a logical progression of ideas.
6. If no explanation can be provided, respond with the original title and make suggestions about what could be covered on the slide.
7. Provide only the explanation text without any additional interaction.

Data Format:
The presentation data should be provided as a list of slide objects. Each slide object should be sent in a separate request and follow this format:
{
  "slide-{slide number}": {
    "title": "Title of the slide",
    "text": ["Text content of the slide"]
  }
}

Response Format:
The response should include only the explanation text for each slide.

As we automate this process, please respond with the word 'send' to indicate that you are ready to receive the first slide.

Let's proceed with the automated analysis of the slides, ensuring that we receive concise and straightforward explanations for each slide without any interactive text.
